      <h1>Join the Circus (of Cuddles and Chaos) at Bark Avenue!</h1>

      <p>
        <b>A Chief Cuddle Officer & Poop Scooping Extraordinaire</b> is being
        sought (with benefits including unlimited puppy breath and gratuitous
        purrs) to join the crew.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Mission, Should You Choose to Accept It (And It Is Highly
        Recommended):
      </p>
      <p>
        Master of the Crate Escape: Ensure the timely and safe departure of
        residents (into loving homes, of course!).
        <br />
        Negotiator of Nuzzles: Facilitate harmonious interactions between
        residents, some of whom may have strong personalities.
        <br /> Professional Belly Rubber: Be on standby for immediate deployment
        of tummy rubs and chin scratches, as per resident requirements.
        <br /> Feast Facilitator: Dispense delicious meals (and sometimes
        questionable snacks smuggled by the more cunning residents) on a
        rigorous schedule.
        <br /> Environmental Enrichment Expert: Provide stimulating play,
        comfortable spaces, and plenty of squeaky toys to keep residents
        entertained.
        <br /> Chief Litter Box Landscaper (for the feline division): Maintain
        pristine accommodations for discerning feline friends.
        <br /> Occasional Target for Playful Bites (no actual harm intended):
        Develop quick reflexes and a good sense of humor for enthusiastic
        greetings.
        <br /> Emotional Support Human: Be a beacon of comfort and reassurance
        for both residents and the occasional overwhelmed volunteer.
        <br /> The Purr-fect Candidate Will Possess: An unwavering love for
        animals (even those who think "personal space" is a myth). A strong
        bladder and an even stronger stomach (it's a shelter, after all). A keen
        eye for a good adoption photo op (bonus points for using props and
        costumes). Excellent communication skills (especially when mediating
        arguments between a territorial chihuahua and a sassy Siamese). A desire
        to make a real difference, one wagging tail or contented purr at a time.
        Bonus Points Awarded For: Expertise in decoding dramatic sighs from
        elderly dogs. The ability to untangle a cat from a Christmas tree
        without losing an eye. Knowledge of obscure animal trivia. The
        resilience to resist taking home all the fosters. Ready to Trade a
        Cubicle for Cuddles? If ready for a job where every day is an adventure,
        and colleagues have fur and four legs, send a resume (and a short story
        about your most memorable animal encounter) to woof@bark.org or visit
        [shelter website] to apply. We are looking forward to meeting you (and
        so are the residents)!
