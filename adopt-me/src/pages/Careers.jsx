      <p>The Purr-fect Candidate Will Possess:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          An unwavering love for animals (even those who think "personal space"
          is a myth).
        </li>

        <li>
          A strong bladder and an even stronger stomach (it's a shelter, after
          all).
        </li>

        <li>
          A keen eye for a good adoption photo op (bonus points for using props
          and costumes).
        </li>

        <li>
          Excellent communication skills (especially when mediating arguments
          between a territorial chihuahua and a sassy Siamese).
        </li>

        <li>
          A desire to make a real difference, one wagging tail or contented purr
          at a time.
        </li>
      </ul>

        {" "}
